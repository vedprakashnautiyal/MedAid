## Project Setup {setup}

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedprakashnautiyal/MedAid.git
cd MedAid
```

### 2️⃣ Create Environment File

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add API keys or other environment variables:

```bash
# Speech API Key 
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=

# Web Search API Key
TAVILY_API_KEY=

# Hugging Face Token (For ReRanker Model -  "ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-6" )
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=

# For Gemini API (Can use other LLMs like Ollama Based or OpenAI but need code modification)
